description: "A confident black-and-white editorial frame interrupted by oversized, hand-cut pastel color blocks. The marketing canvas is rigorously monochrome — figmaSans variable type, pure white surfaces, pure black ink, pill-shaped CTAs — while each story section drops the page into a saturated lime, lavender, cream, mint, or pink panel that reads like a sticky note placed on a clean desk. The result is a design system that feels both technical and joyful — a tool for serious work, made by people who like color."

## Overview

Figma's marketing canvas is, at the system level, an editor-clean black-and-white frame. The chrome — top nav, body type, footer, primary CTA — is monochrome. Headlines are oversized `{typography.display-xl}` set in `figmaSans` with aggressive negative tracking, body copy hovers around weight 320–340 of the same variable family, and small mono `{typography.eyebrow}` and `{typography.caption}` labels (figmaMono, all-caps, positive tracking) act as section markers. Every CTA is a pill — `{rounded.pill}` — and the primary action across the entire site is the same black `{components.button-primary}` paired with the same white `{components.button-secondary}`.

What makes the design unique is what happens **between** those monochrome bookends: the page repeatedly drops into oversized pastel **color-block sections** — lime, lavender, cream, mint, pink, coral, and a deep navy — that span the full content width with `{rounded.lg}` corners and `{spacing.xxl}` interior padding. These blocks are where the storytelling lives. They aren't accents tucked into a card; they take over a whole viewport's worth of vertical space, like a designer arranging giant sticky notes on a clean wall. FigJam is the most pastel-saturated, the home page rotates through the full set, and the pricing page ends with a lime FAQ panel — same vocabulary, different rhythm per route.

This is a system built on contrast: the monochrome chrome makes the color blocks feel intentional rather than decorative, and the color blocks make the monochrome chrome feel like editorial paper rather than enterprise SaaS. Density is generous, line-heights are tight on display sizes, and the interface never reaches for shadows or gradients to do the work that color blocks and confident typography already do.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Monochrome system core: `{colors.primary}` (black) and `{colors.canvas}` (white) carry every CTA, every body line, every footer link.
- Oversized pastel **color-block sections** (`{colors.block-lime}`, `{colors.block-lilac}`, `{colors.block-cream}`, `{colors.block-mint}`, `{colors.block-pink}`, `{colors.block-coral}`, `{colors.block-navy}`) define the narrative rhythm of every long-form page.
- Pill is the only button shape — `{rounded.pill}` for text CTAs, `{rounded.full}` for icon buttons. No square buttons anywhere.
- `figmaSans` variable typeface used at unusually fine weight increments (320, 330, 340, 450, 480, 540) — the type system reads as a single voice that flexes rather than a multi-weight family.
- Tight negative letter-spacing on display sizes (-1.72px at 86px, -0.96px at 64px) creates a confident editorial cadence.
- `figmaMono` reserved for category labels, eyebrows, and captions — always uppercase, positive tracking — to flag taxonomy without competing with display type.
- Color-block page rhythm (home): white hero → marquee strip → white feature → lime systems block → navy ship-products block → coral developer block → white template grid → white footer.

## Colors

> Source pages: figma.com (home), /design/, /figjam/brainstorming-tool/, /pricing/, /contact/.

### Brand & Accent
- **Black** ({colors.primary}): The system primary. Every primary CTA, every headline, every body line, the marquee strip, the inverse canvas of dark sections.
- **White** ({colors.on-primary}): Inverse text on black surfaces; also the canvas color used as the foreground of secondary pill buttons (`{components.button-secondary}`).
- **Magenta Promo** ({colors.accent-magenta}): A single saturated CTA pink reserved for promotional inline buttons — appears, for example, on the lilac "Save your spot" Release Notes banner. Use scarcely; it is not a section color.

### Surface
- **Canvas** ({colors.canvas}): Default page background and the body of every white card.
- **Inverse Canvas** ({colors.inverse-canvas}): Footer, marquee strip, and a subset of "ship products"-style story sections.
- **Surface Soft** ({colors.surface-soft}): Off-white tile background used for icon buttons, template cards, and feature illustration tiles when they sit on the white canvas.
- **Hairline** ({colors.hairline}): 1px borders on form inputs, pricing cards, and table dividers.
- **Hairline Soft** ({colors.hairline-soft}): Even subtler dividers — comparison-table row separators and footer column rules.
- **Block Lime** ({colors.block-lime}): The signature **systems / FAQ / contact-form** color block. Recurs across home, pricing, contact.
- **Block Lilac** ({colors.block-lilac}): Hero block on `/design/`; also the inline Release Notes promo banner.
- **Block Cream** ({colors.block-cream}): Soft warm background — FigJam hero strip, template-grid section.
- **Block Mint** ({colors.block-mint}): FigJam pastel section.
- **Block Pink** ({colors.block-pink}): FigJam pastel section.
- **Block Coral** ({colors.block-coral}): "Ship products" coral story block on home.
- **Block Navy** ({colors.block-navy}): Deep indigo story block — only place dark surfaces appear above the footer.

### Text
- **Ink** ({colors.ink}): All headline, body, and caption type on light surfaces. There is no softer mid-gray text role on marketing — body copy is always black at weight 320–340, and weight (not opacity) carries the hierarchy.
- **Inverse Ink** ({colors.inverse-ink}): Type on inverse-canvas surfaces (footer, marquee strip, navy color block).
- **On-Inverse Soft** ({colors.on-inverse-soft}): White used at ~16% opacity for circular icon-button surfaces against dark sections (token captures the base color; the translucency is applied at render time).

### Semantic
- **Success Green** ({colors.semantic-success}): Comparison-table checkmarks on pricing. Used as a glyph fill, not a surface.
- **Overlay Scrim** ({colors.overlay-scrim}): Black used at ~60% opacity behind modal / video-overlay surfaces (token captures the base; opacity applied at render time).

## Typography

### Font Family

- **figmaSans** — Figma's proprietary variable typeface; fallback stack `figmaSans Fallback, SF Pro Display, system-ui, helvetica`. Variable weight axis is exercised at unusually fine increments (320, 330, 340, 450, 480, 540, 700) — the design system reads as a single voice modulating rather than a stepped weight family.
- **figmaMono** — Proprietary monospace; fallback `figmaMono Fallback, SF Mono, menlo`. Used exclusively for eyebrow labels and captions, always uppercase with positive letter-spacing.

OpenType `kern` is enabled across every role.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 86px | 340 | 1.00 | -1.72px | Hero headlines (home, FigJam) |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 64px | 340 | 1.10 | -0.96px | Section opener headlines |
| `{typography.headline}` | 26px | 540 | 1.35 | -0.26px | Story-block titles inside color blocks |
| `{typography.subhead}` | 26px | 340 | 1.35 | -0.26px | Long-form intro paragraphs that sit at near-headline scale |
| `{typography.card-title}` | 24px | 700 | 1.45 | 0 | Pricing-tier titles, feature card titles |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 20px | 330 | 1.40 | -0.14px | Lead body copy on hero, contact form labels |
| `{typography.body}` | 18px | 320 | 1.45 | -0.26px | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 16px | 330 | 1.45 | -0.14px | Card body, footer link list |
| `{typography.link}` | 20px | 480 | 1.40 | -0.10px | Inline link emphasis |
| `{typography.button}` | 20px | 480 | 1.40 | -0.10px | All pill buttons, primary and secondary |
| `{typography.eyebrow}` | 18px | 400 | 1.30 | 0.54px | figmaMono uppercase section eyebrows |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 1.00 | 0.60px | figmaMono uppercase captions, footer column heads |

### Principles

- **Weight, not size, carries hierarchy on body copy.** A 20px paragraph at weight 330 sits next to a 20px link at weight 480 — the eye reads emphasis without scale change.
- **Negative letter-spacing scales with size.** Display-xl pulls -1.72px; subhead pulls only -0.26px. Body copy stays near-zero. The result is editorial-feeling display type without sacrificing readability at body size.
- **Mono is taxonomy, not body.** figmaMono is reserved for eyebrows and captions — never used to set a paragraph.
- **Tight line-heights on display, generous on body.** Display sizes run 1.00–1.10; body runs 1.40–1.45. The contrast reinforces that headlines are graphics and body copy is for reading.

### Note on Font Substitutes

If implementing without access to figmaSans / figmaMono, suitable open-source substitutes are **Inter** (or **Geist**) for the sans, and **JetBrains Mono** (or **Geist Mono**) for the mono. Inter at variable weights closely matches the fine-grained weight axis figmaSans uses; expect to manually adjust line-heights down by ~0.02 to compensate for Inter's slightly taller x-height.

## Layout

### Spacing System

- **Base unit**: 8px.
- **Tokens (front matter)**: `{spacing.hair}` 1px · `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 24px · `{spacing.xl}` 32px · `{spacing.xxl}` 48px · `{spacing.section}` 96px.
- Section interior padding: `{spacing.xxl}` (48px) on color-block sections.
- Card interior padding: `{spacing.lg}` (24px) on pricing cards and template tiles.
- Form input padding: `{spacing.sm}` 12px vertical · 14px horizontal.
- Button padding: `{spacing.xs}` 8px vertical · `{spacing.lg}` 24px horizontal for pill buttons (the asymmetric `8px 18px 10px` extracted on `button-secondary` nudges the type optically inside the pill).
- Universal rhythm constant: `{spacing.section}` (96px) — the vertical gap between major content sections holds across home, pricing, and FigJam pages.

### Grid & Container

- Max content width sits around 1280px (one of the explicit breakpoints), with side gutters that scale from `{spacing.xxl}` on desktop down to `{spacing.lg}` on mobile.
- Three- and four-column grids on the desktop pricing comparison and FigJam template galleries.
- Color-block sections break the column grid — they span content width with full bleed inside the rounded `{rounded.lg}` corners, then place a single editorial column of headline + body inside.

### Whitespace Philosophy

White space is used to make the color blocks feel deliberate. Between every colored panel and the next, the page returns to white canvas with `{spacing.section}` of breathing room. Inside a color block, the type itself is given generous side margins (often more than 1/4 of the block's width on each side) so the panel reads as a poster, not a wall of copy.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (flat) | No shadow, no border | Default for color-block sections, inverse-canvas footer, hero |
| 1 (hairline) | 1px `{colors.hairline}` border on `{colors.canvas}` | Pricing cards, form inputs, comparison table cells |
| 2 (soft elevation) | Subtle drop shadow approx 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06) | Floating template tiles, dropdown menus |
| 3 (modal) | Stronger shadow + `{colors.overlay-scrim}` behind | Video / image lightbox overlays |

Figma's marketing system is shadow-light by design — the color blocks substitute for traditional elevation. Where most SaaS sites use a shadowed white card to draw attention, Figma uses a saturated background panel. This makes the rare actual shadow (e.g., a floating template card hovering over a cream section) feel like an exception worth noticing.

### Decorative Depth

- **Color-block sections** are the primary depth device. The change from white canvas to lime / lavender / cream is the section break.
- **Sticky-note style component thumbnails** in FigJam — slightly off-axis pastel rectangles arranged like notes on a board — read as collage, not card-stack.
- **Embedded product UI mocks** (Figma Design panels, FigJam canvas snippets) appear as flat compositions on color blocks; their internal shadows are subtle and stay within the mock.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 2px | Anchor / link decoration corners |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 6px | Small chips, sub-nav tabs |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Form inputs, list items, image frames |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 24px | Pricing cards, color-block sections, large image containers |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 32px | Hero feature panels, oversized callouts |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 50px | All text CTAs (primary, secondary, tab toggles) |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Circular icon buttons, comparison-table checkmark glyphs |

### Photography & Illustration Geometry

- Image frames use `{rounded.md}` (8px) — generous enough to feel friendly, conservative enough to read as editorial.
- Template thumbnails on the home grid sit in `{rounded.md}` tiles with `{spacing.md}` interior padding around the embedded preview.
- FigJam pastel sticky-note component thumbnails preserve a small `{rounded.sm}` corner that mimics actual sticky paper.
- No avatar circles appear in marketing surfaces — Figma's marketing avoids personification.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — The black "Get started for free" pill that appears in the top nav, every hero, and every closing CTA.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button}`, padding 10px 20px, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.
- Pressed state lives in `button-primary-pressed` (same surface; the live site relies on micro-scale rather than a darkened fill).

**`button-secondary`** — White pill with black text. Used for tertiary navigation actions ("Contact sales") and as the visual counterpart to the primary pill.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.button}`, padding 8px 18px 10px (asymmetric vertical to optically center the type), rounded `{rounded.pill}`. No border.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — Plain text link styled as a button hit target inside top nav and footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.link}`, rounded `{rounded.full}` (hit target only), padding `{spacing.xs}` `{spacing.sm}`.

**`button-icon-circular`** — 40px circular icon button used for carousel controls, social links, and inline actions on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`, size 40px.

**`button-icon-circular-inverse`** — Same shape, used on inverse-canvas / dark color blocks.
- Background `{colors.on-inverse-soft}` (translucent white), text `{colors.inverse-ink}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`, size 40px.

**`button-magenta-promo`** — Saturated pink pill used only inside promotional surfaces such as the lilac "Save your spot" Release Notes banner. Reserved for moments where Figma's product team wants the CTA to pop against an already-colored panel.
- Background `{colors.accent-magenta}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button}`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`, padding 10px 18px.

### Pricing Tabs

**`pricing-tab-default`** + **`pricing-tab-selected`** — The pill-toggle that switches between Starter / Professional / Organization / Enterprise on `/pricing/`.
- Default: `{colors.canvas}` background, `{colors.ink}` text, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.
- Selected: `{colors.primary}` background, `{colors.on-primary}` text — exactly the same surface as `button-primary`, which makes the selected tab feel like an active CTA, not a passive state.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** + **`text-input-focused`** — Form fields on `/contact/` and pricing seat-count steppers.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding 12px 14px.
- Focused state retains the same surface — focus is communicated via ring, not via fill change.

### Cards & Containers

**`pricing-card`** — Each tier on `/pricing/`.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.lg}`. Stroked with `{colors.hairline}` rather than shadowed.

**`pricing-card-feature-row`** — Single row inside the comparison table.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`. Row separator is `{colors.hairline-soft}`.

**`template-card`** — Thumbnail tile in the home "Explore what people are making" grid and the FigJam template gallery.
- Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding `{spacing.md}`.

**`feature-illustration-tile`** — Larger composition tile that holds a product UI mock or pastel illustration.
- Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.eyebrow}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding `{spacing.lg}`.

### Color-Block Sections (signature)

The defining surface of Figma's marketing. Each is a full-content-width panel with `{rounded.lg}` corners and `{spacing.xxl}` interior padding. Variants:

**`color-block-section`** — lime ground for "systems" stories (home), pricing FAQ, and the contact form.
- Background `{colors.block-lime}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.subhead}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`.

**`color-block-section-lilac`** — lavender ground for `/design/` hero and FigJam highlight sections.
- Background `{colors.block-lilac}`, otherwise identical structure.

**`color-block-section-navy`** — deep indigo ground for the home "Ship products" story block. The only inverse color-block surface above the footer.
- Background `{colors.block-navy}`, text `{colors.inverse-ink}`, otherwise identical structure.

(Cream, mint, pink, and coral block variants follow the same shape with their respective `{colors.block-*}` surface.)

### Promo Banner

**`promo-banner-lilac`** — The Release Notes / "Save your spot" inline banner that floats above the contact form.
- Background `{colors.block-lilac}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding `{spacing.md}` `{spacing.lg}`. Carries a `button-magenta-promo` on the right edge.

### Navigation

**`top-nav`** — Sticky white bar with logo, primary nav links, sign-in link, and the right-anchored `button-secondary` ("Contact sales") + `button-primary` ("Get started for free") pair.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, height 56px.
- Mobile: collapses primary links into a hamburger that opens a full-canvas overlay; the two pill CTAs remain visible on the bar.

**`marquee-strip`** — Thin black ribbon directly under the nav that scrolls through customer logos in white.
- Background `{colors.inverse-canvas}`, text `{colors.inverse-ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, height 36px.

### Comparison Glyphs

**`comparison-checkmark`** — Green check used in the pricing comparison matrix.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, glyph color `{colors.semantic-success}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`, size 16px.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Dense link grid on white canvas with the wordmark "Figma" set in display weight at the top-left.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.caption}` for column headings and small links, padding `{spacing.section}` top/bottom · `{spacing.xl}` sides.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for genuine primary CTAs and selected states (e.g., `pricing-tab-selected`). Don't use it as a decorative accent.
- When introducing a story section, choose **one** color block from the `{colors.block-*}` family and let it span full content width with `{rounded.lg}` corners and `{spacing.xxl}` interior padding.
- Keep type in `figmaSans` at variable weights — pick from 320, 330, 340, 480, 540, 700 to express hierarchy. Avoid intermediate weights outside this set.
- Use `figmaMono` only for eyebrows and captions, always uppercase, with the documented positive letter-spacing.
- Compose every CTA as a pill (`{rounded.pill}`) and every icon button as a circle (`{rounded.full}`).
- Allow the page to **return to white canvas** between every two color blocks so each block reads as deliberate.
- Pair `button-primary` and `button-secondary` whenever a section needs both a primary action and a sales / secondary action — the black-and-white pair is the brand signature.

### Don't

- Don't introduce mid-gray text. Body hierarchy comes from `figmaSans` weight, not from opacity.
- Don't add drop shadows to color-block sections — the color is the depth device.
- Don't introduce new accent colors outside the documented `{colors.block-*}` palette and `{colors.accent-magenta}`. Adding, e.g., a saturated brand orange would break the system.
- Don't combine more than one color block visible inside a single viewport — Figma's pacing always lets the white canvas separate them.
- Don't square off CTAs. Square buttons read as a different brand.
- Don't put `figmaMono` in body copy — it's a taxonomy tool, not a reading typeface.
- Don't replace the `pricing-tab-selected` black fill with a colored tab; the brand pattern is "selected = primary surface".

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 4k | 1920px | Max content width holds at 1280px; gutters expand |
| Desktop-XL | 1440px | Default desktop layout |
| Desktop | 1400px | Comparison table column widths normalize |
| Desktop-S | 1280px | Pricing 4-up tier grid maintained |
| Tablet | 960px | Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up; nav becomes hamburger |
| Mobile-L | 768px | Color-block sections become full-bleed (no rounded corners on edges) |
| Mobile | 560px | Display-xl reduces from 86px to ~48px; pill CTAs go full-width |
| Mobile-XS | 559px | Two-column footer collapses to single column |

### Touch Targets

- Pill buttons (`button-primary`, `button-secondary`) maintain a minimum 44px tap height across all viewports — achieved by combining `{typography.button}` 20px line-height with the documented vertical padding.
- Circular icon buttons (`button-icon-circular`) are 40px on desktop and grow to 44px on touch viewports.
- Form input minimum tap target on `/contact/` is 48px high.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Nav**: desktop horizontal nav with two right-anchored pills collapses to a hamburger overlay below 960px. The two pills (`Contact sales`, `Get started for free`) stay visible on the bar above 560px and stack in the overlay below.
- **Pricing tier grid**: 4-up → 2-up at 960px → 1-up below 768px. The pill toggle stays horizontal and scrolls horizontally if needed below 560px.
- **Color-block sections**: above 768px the section keeps `{spacing.xxl}` of canvas around it so the rounded corners read; below 768px the corners are removed and the block bleeds to viewport edge for a poster effect.
- **Comparison table**: below 960px the matrix collapses into per-tier accordions to avoid horizontal scroll.

### Image Behavior

- Product UI mocks inside color blocks scale proportionally and never crop. Below 768px they shrink rather than reflow.
- Template thumbnails in the home grid use lazy loading and animate in on scroll.
- Sticky-note style FigJam thumbnails maintain their slight off-axis rotation across breakpoints — the rotation is a brand signal, not a desktop-only flourish.

## Application Surfaces

> The sections above document Figma's **marketing canvas**. Cloud AI is a *product* — an AI website builder with a sidebar, a prompt composer, a dashboard, dropdowns, modals, and settings. Those surfaces reuse the marketing system's type, radius, spacing, and pill language, but they need an additional role layer because they ship in **both light and dark** (marketing is light-only). This section documents that layer.

### The two token layers

1. **Brand tokens** (`colors.*`, `rounded.*`, `spacing.*`, `typography.*`) — theme-invariant. A pill is always `{rounded.pill}`; lime is always `#dceeb1`. These never change between light and dark.
2. **Application role tokens** (`--app-*` in `globals.css`) — theme-aware. They resolve to different brand values per theme. `--app-page-bg` is `{colors.canvas}` in light and `{colors.inverse-canvas}` in dark. **Always style product chrome with role tokens, never with raw `colors.*`**, so a surface follows the active theme automatically.

### Role token reference

| Role token | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--app-page-bg` | `{colors.canvas}` | `{colors.inverse-canvas}` | Outermost page background |
| `--app-panel` | `{colors.canvas}` | `#000000` | Cards, modals, sidebar, dropdowns |
| `--app-control` | `{colors.canvas}` | `#080808` | Inputs, buttons-as-surfaces, tiles |
| `--app-panel-strong` | `{colors.surface-soft}` | `{colors.block-navy}` | Raised / emphasised panel |
| `--app-text` | `{colors.ink}` | `{colors.inverse-ink}` | Primary body + heading text |
| `--app-muted` | ink @ 62% | white @ 66% | Secondary text, captions |
| `--app-subtle` | ink @ 42% | white @ 46% | Placeholders, disabled labels |
| `--app-border` | `{colors.hairline}` | white @ 18% | Hairline dividers, input borders |
| `--app-border-strong` | `{colors.primary}` | `{colors.inverse-ink}` | Focused / hovered border |
| `--app-selected-bg` / `--app-selected-text` | black / white | white / black | Active nav item, selected tab, selected option |
| `--app-focus-ring` | ink @ 28% | white @ 38% | Keyboard focus ring |
| `--app-danger-bg` / `--app-danger-text` | `{colors.block-coral}` / ink | `#3d1915` / white | Inline error surfaces |
| `--app-pill-*` | black pill | white pill | The composer's primary send action |
| `--app-composer-*` | — | — | Prompt-composer specific bg/border/placeholder |
| `--app-sidebar-*` | — | — | Sidebar specific bg/control/border |
| `--app-dropdown-*` | — | — | Menu/popover specific bg/control/border |

### Principles for product surfaces

- **Hierarchy by weight and role, not opacity-on-raw-color.** Use `--app-muted` / `--app-subtle` for secondary text — never `text-black/60` or hand-mixed alphas. This keeps both themes legible.
- **Borders, not shadows, by default.** Product cards use a 1px `--app-border`. The brand is shadow-light (Elevation table above). Reserve `{boxShadow.panel}` for genuinely floating layers (dropdowns, modals).
- **Selected = primary surface.** Mirror the marketing `pricing-tab-selected` rule: an active sidebar item, theme option, or tab uses `--app-selected-bg` (the inverse of the page), exactly as the marketing system flips a selected tab to black.
- **Pills and circles only.** Product CTAs stay `{rounded.pill}`; icon buttons stay `{rounded.full}`. Containers use `{rounded.lg}`, inputs `{rounded.md}`. No square interactive elements — same rule as marketing.
- **Color blocks still carry narrative.** The dashboard hero sits on a `{colors.block-lilac}` panel; the home prompt sits on lilac; suggestion-idea groups use lime / cream / navy. Product surfaces are allowed the full `{colors.block-*}` palette, but obey the marketing pacing rule: one block per visual zone, canvas between zones.

## Motion & Interaction

> This section fills the "Known Gap" noted earlier — the live site's animations were not documented. Cloud AI is an interactive builder, so motion is part of the system, not an afterthought. Motion is **cinematic but disciplined**: it directs attention and confirms action; it never blocks input or runs longer than needed.

### Motion tokens (front matter `motion:`)

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration-instant}` | 120ms | Color/opacity hover feedback |
| `{motion.duration-fast}` | 200ms | Hover lift, press, small state changes |
| `{motion.duration-base}` | 280ms | Default transition; panel + composer focus |
| `{motion.duration-slow}` | 420ms | Reveal-on-scroll entrance, modal open |
| `{motion.duration-cinematic}` | 720ms | Hero headline / large color-block entrance |
| `{motion.ease-standard}` | `cubic-bezier(0.22,0.61,0.36,1)` | Default easing — decelerating, editorial |
| `{motion.ease-spring}` | `cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)` | Press release, icon pops, playful overshoot |
| `{motion.ease-exit}` | `cubic-bezier(0.4,0,1,1)` | Elements leaving (modal close, dismiss) |
| `{motion.stagger-step}` | 70ms | Delay between siblings in a cascade |
| `{motion.reveal-distance}` | 24px | Y-translation an element travels on entrance |
| `{motion.press-scale}` | 0.97 | `transform: scale()` on `:active` |
| `{motion.hover-lift}` | -2px | `translateY()` on hover for cards/buttons |

### Patterns

- **Scroll-reveal (the signature product motion).** Elements enter as the viewport reaches them: `opacity 0→1` + `translateY({motion.reveal-distance})→0`, over `{motion.duration-slow}` with `{motion.ease-standard}`. Driven by `IntersectionObserver` via the `useReveal` hook → `[data-reveal]` / `[data-reveal-ready]` attributes in `globals.css`. Reveal **once**, then stay (no re-trigger on scroll-up).
- **Staggered cascade.** Sibling groups (suggestion chips, color-block cards, sidebar items, dashboard tiles) reveal in sequence using `--reveal-index` × `{motion.stagger-step}` as `transition-delay`. Never mount a group all at once.
- **Spring press.** Every button/pill/icon-button compresses to `{motion.press-scale}` on `:active` and releases with `{motion.ease-spring}`. This is the "physical click" feel.
- **Hover lift.** Cards and pills translate `{motion.hover-lift}` on hover over `{motion.duration-fast}`. Pair with a border or background shift, never a hover-only shadow.
- **Parallax accents (subtle).** Large color-block panels may drift their decorative layer a few px against scroll. Keep displacement small (≤ 12px) — this is texture, not a theme-park ride. Decorative-only; never move text or interactive targets.
- **Focus-within rise.** The prompt composer lifts `{motion.hover-lift}` and grows its focus ring when focused, signalling "this is where you type."

### Performance & accessibility (mandatory)

- **Animate only `transform` and `opacity`.** Never animate `top`/`left`/`width`/`height`/`box-shadow` for entrance or movement — they thrash layout. GPU-friendly properties only.
- **Honour `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.** A global guard in `globals.css` collapses all reveal/parallax/stagger to an instant final state and near-zero transition. Motion is an enhancement; the UI must be fully usable and immediately visible without it.
- **Never block interaction.** Entrances run on mount/scroll but inputs are live immediately. No motion gates a click.
- **Respect `scroll-behavior: smooth`** for in-page anchors, but keep route changes instant.

## Responsive Display Type

Display sizes are fixed px in the type scale for fidelity, but **must render fluid** so an 86px hero doesn't overflow a 360px phone. Use the `fontSizeFluid` clamp values:

| Token | Fixed | Fluid (clamp) |
|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 86px | `clamp(40px, 7vw, 86px)` |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 64px | `clamp(34px, 5.5vw, 64px)` |

Letter-spacing is authored for the **max** size; at clamped-down sizes the negative tracking stays proportionally fine because it scales with the cap. Headline/body tokens (≤ 26px) do not need clamping — they're already mobile-safe.

## Theme System

- **Default: `system`.** First load follows `prefers-color-scheme`; the choice persists to `localStorage` (`cloud-ai-theme`) and is exposed through the settings appearance picker and the user menu. Three options: Light, Dark, System.
- **Light is the canonical brand surface** — it is the editorial black-on-white frame the marketing sections document. Dark is a faithful inverse built from `{colors.inverse-canvas}` / `{colors.inverse-ink}` and the role-token table above, not a separate palette.
- **`theme-color` meta** should track the active page background (`{colors.canvas}` light, `{colors.inverse-canvas}` dark) so the mobile browser chrome matches — not an arbitrary slate.
- Selected states in both themes use the **inverse of the page** (`--app-selected-bg`), preserving the "selected = primary surface" brand rule across themes.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time and reference it by its `components:` token name (e.g., `{components.button-primary}`, `{components.color-block-section}`).
2. When introducing a new section, decide **first** which `{colors.block-*}` token it sits on; the surface choice is the most consequential decision.
3. Default body type to `{typography.body}`; reach for `{typography.subhead}` or `{typography.headline}` only inside a color block.
4. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits — `broken-ref`, `contrast-ratio`, and `orphaned-tokens` warnings flag issues automatically.
5. Add new variants as separate component entries (`-pressed`, `-selected`) — do not bury them in prose.
6. Keep `{colors.primary}` scarce. If two `button-primary` instances appear in the same viewport, the section is doing too much — neutralize one to `button-secondary`.
7. Treat `{colors.accent-magenta}` as a single-shot color: one promo CTA per page, never two.

## Known Gaps

- The exact pastel hex values of `{colors.block-*}` are derived from screenshot pixels; the production source likely uses named tokens that aren't exposed via CSS variables. Treat the documented hex values as faithful approximations rather than exact brand specs.
- Form-field error and validation styling on the marketing `/contact/` page is not documented (no error states render in the static screenshot). For **product** surfaces, inline errors use `--app-danger-bg` / `--app-danger-text` with `{rounded.md}` corners — see Application Surfaces.

> **Resolved gaps:** Dark mode and animation, previously listed as gaps, are now documented — see the **Theme System**, **Application Surfaces**, and **Motion & Interaction** sections, which cover the product UI layer the marketing screenshots did not expose.
